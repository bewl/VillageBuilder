2. See how many working (green)
3. Assign more families if available (white)

## Common Questions

**Q: Why can't I click a yellow family?**
A: They're busy at another building. Unassign them there first, or choose a white (available) family.

**Q: What if all families show yellow?**
A: Everyone is working! You need to either:
   - Build a house to attract new families
   - Unassign a family from less critical work
   - Wait for children to grow up (future feature)

**Q: Why is a family grayed out?**
A: "No workers available" means all adults in that family are assigned elsewhere.

**Q: Can I see where a yellow family is working?**
A: Yes! The text shows "(at Farm)" or "(at Mine)" etc.

**Q: Can children work?**
A: Not currently. Only adults (18+) can be assigned to work.
